<ul><li> "Joe is a pleasure to work with! He edited my 20,000-word novella, providing both line edits and big-picture feedback on the structure, flow, and plot of the book. Joe is nitpicky in the best way possible and gives the kind of detailed comments you want (and need) on your writing. Though I have enlisted four wonderful readers to workshop this book so far, Joe’s edits provided something unique. Specifically, he gave me insightful comments about character development and narrative voice that I really needed to move the work forward. I came away feeling excited about the ideas Joe generously shared for my novella, and inspired by the books he recommended I read and consider, which were all new to me. He is clearly an expert at writing and editing, and though I have only known him for less than a year, I came to truly value and trust his opinions. Plus, Joe is easy to get in contact with and very responsive, which is not always a given." <a href= "https://alitomek.com/" target= "_blank"> – Ali Tomek</a></li>

<li>"I am lost in an unending series of reality shifts, swallowed by fissures in existence, spat into alternate timelines. I’ve seen millions of other worlds and other ways in which things can be, and you’d think that Joe Demes would only exist in a handful of these alternate realities and that he would be a highly talented editor in only two or three of those worlds. False. Joe Demes exists in every timeline and Joe Demes is a highly talented editor within each of those. Joe's narrative instincts are loving and nurturing. Joe is a man of wit and extrasensory perception. Without his contributions, <i>What's On the Menu?</i> would be missing essential appetizers and entrées. In every reality, the man is word baby mid-wife. Trust your word babies with the editor from every timeline." – Chase Griffin, author of <a href="https://longdaypress.square.site/product/what-s-on-the-menu-by-chase-griffin/31?cs=true" target="_blank"><i>What's On the Menu?</i></a> [Long Day Press]</li>
